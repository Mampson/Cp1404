# line 1 produced number = 16 the lowest possible number would have been 5 and highest would be 20
# line 2 produced an error msg , however i believe it was suppose to be from 3 to 10 in 2 unit increments ?
# if this was the case then no 4 could not have been produced

#line 3 produced a floating point number between 2.5 and 5.5 the smallest number would have been 2.5
#the largest would have been 5.499 or 5.5 dependent on the rounding
